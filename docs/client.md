<div style="text-align:left;color:#990033; font-family:times, serif; font-size:3.0em">The pymata-cpx Client Library</div>

<br>
The pymata-cpx library provides an easy to use Python3 
[API.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-cpx/blob/master/docs/api.ht)
Using pymata-cpx, you can control and
monitor the Playground Express on-board actuators and sensors, remotely from your computer.

Working examples are provided in the Usage section of this guide
 to illustrate using the API.

Please note that pymata-cpx is not compatible with the firmware provided by
Adafruit. You must use the FirmataCPx firmware in conjunction with this client. FirmataCPx is
discussed in the next section of this document.
